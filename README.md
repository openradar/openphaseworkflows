RUN THE CODE:

--Pangeo Badge to come--

Acronyms are hard, so we are just calling this the Phase Processing MAFIA or Multi Agency Focused Investigative
Activity. There are multiple aims to this repository and associated MAFIA:

* Provide a set of shovel ready cook books and scripts for phase processing code (see below for what we mean by
phase processing). 

* Demystify the configuration of these techniques. 

* Discover interesting cases (both well behaved and corner) and provide live download links to these files so
examples can be run. Cover X,C amd S band (and perhaps expand to Ka).

* Break down barriers to working with dual pol radar.

* Show examples of working with KDP once processed. 

Unlike the Mafia, in the MAFIA all are welcome to join.
